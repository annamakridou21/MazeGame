# VGA Maze Game

A SystemVerilog implementation of a simple maze game with VGA output. This project demonstrates VGA timing, sprite rendering, and game logic using hardware description language.

- A complete VGA-based maze game that can run on FPGA
- VGA display controller with proper sync timing
- Sprite-based player character that can move through the maze
- ROM-based maze and graphics storage
- Input debouncing for clean button presses
- Clock management for VGA timing
- Basic collision detection between player and walls

## Components

The project consists of VGA timing generation, maze rendering, player movement control, and sprite graphics stored in ROMs. All modules are written in SystemVerilog and work together to create an interactive maze game suitable for FPGA implementation.
